# Gapminder Dataset Exploration And Correlation Between Inequality, Life Expectancy, and Sugar Consumption

This repository is for the final project of Developing Data Products in Coursera.

The app based on the codes from this repo has been published in this link:  https://berj.shinyapps.io/single/

The dataset is based on https://www.gapminder.org/data/. For the purpose of this app, the dataset used is sugar_per_person.csv, lex.csv, and gini.csv. The combined dataset contains data about sugar consumption per person per gram per day, life expectancy at birth, and gini index, of countries around the world. the data range has been diminished from the early 60's till 2018

The app has a sidebar which allows anyone to choose 3 countries, two datasets, and a range of years. The main panel of the app is divided into three tabs. The first has 2 plots to demonstrate the evolution of the selected data sets over the selected years in the selected countries. The second one has a plot to show the relationship between the two selected data sets and a numerical output of the regression coefficient sensitive to the selected countries and range of years. The last tab explains the abbreviations of the data sets and explains what they entail
