# Gapminder Dataset Exploration And Correlation Between Inequality, Life Expectancy, and Sugar Consumption

This repository is for the final project of Developing Data Products in Coursera.

The app based on the codes from this repo has been published in this link:  https://berj.shinyapps.io/single/

Dataset is based on https://www.gapminder.org/data/. For the purpose of this app, the dataset used is sugar_per_person.csv, lex.csv, and gini.csv. The combined dataset contains data about suger consumption per person per gram per day, life expectancy at birth, and gini index, of countries around the world. the data range has been diminished from the early 60's till 2018

The app has a sidbar wich allows anyone to choose 3 countries, two datasets, and the range of years. The main pannel of the app is divided into three tabs, the first has 2 plots to demonstarte the evolution of the selected data sets over the selected years in the selected countries. Second wone has a plot to show relationship between the two selected data sets and a numerical output of the regression coeficcient sensetive to the selected countries and range of years. The last tab is to explain the abreviations of the data sets and explain what they entail
